<h1>OOP Concepts in C++</h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. This repository contains code examples, explanations, and a mini-project based on a hotel management system to illustrate the practical applications of these concepts.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Classes are the fundamental building blocks of OOP in C++. They encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data. This section includes examples of how to define and use classes.</p>
<h2>Constructors and Destructors</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Constructors are special member functions that are called when an object is created. Destructors are called when an object is destroyed. This section covers the basics of constructors and destructors, including their syntax and usage.</p>
<h2>Different Types of Constructors</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">In C++, there are various types of constructors, such as default constructors, parameterized constructors, copy constructors, and dynamic constructors. This section provides examples and explanations of each type.</p>
<h2>Different Types of Inheritance</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. This section covers the different types of inheritance in C++, including single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance, with examples for each.</p>
<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This section explains how to achieve encapsulation in C++.</p>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Polymorphism allows for methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. This section explains the two types of polymorphism in C++: compile-time (overloading) and runtime (overriding).</p>
<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Exception handling in C++ is done using try, catch, and throw keywords. This section provides examples of how to handle exceptions in your code to ensure robust and error-free applications.</p>
<h2>Friend Function</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Friend functions are functions that are not members of a class but still have access to the class's private and protected members. This section explains how and when to use friend functions in C++.</p>
<h2>Pure Virtual Function</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">A pure virtual function is a function that has no implementation and must be overridden in derived classes. This section covers the concept of abstract classes and pure virtual functions in C++.</p>
<h2>Enum</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Enums are a user-defined data type in C++ that consists of integral constants. This section explains how to define and use enums in your programs.</p>
<h2>Mini Project: Hotel Management System</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">To demonstrate the practical application of the OOP concepts discussed, this repository includes a mini project based on a hotel management system. This project integrates various OOP principles to create a functional and efficient system.</p>
